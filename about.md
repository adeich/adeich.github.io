I'm a data scientist in San Francisco specializing in simulating and understanding the behavior of complex systems. I have a background in physics and scientific computation. I like writing about computational statistics and physics.

I have a bachelor's degree from Reed College, where I did [my thesis](/assets/docs/deich_reed_thesis.pdf) on the effect of supernovae on orbital systems. I have a master's degree in physics from San Jose State University during which time I also taught high school physics.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a slightly modified version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
