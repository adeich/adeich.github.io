I'm a data scientist in San Francisco with a focus on simulating evolving systems and studying their behavior. With a background in physics and scientific computation, I love writing about statistics and physics and engaging in a broader sense of wonder.

I have a bachelor's degree from Reed College, where I did [my thesis](/assets/docs/deich_reed_thesis.pdf) on the effect of supernovae explosions on orbital systems. I then worked as a software engineer in Boulder, CO, then returned to earn a master's degree in physics at San Jose State University, focusing on computational physics. During my master's work I also worked full time as a high school physics and calculus teacher.


This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modified version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme. If you're curious about details of my Jekyll setup, check out my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/adeich/adeich.github.io) for all the code used to build this website.
