I'm a data scientist in San Francisco with a specialty for simulating interesting systems and studying their behavior. With a background in physics and scientific computation, I love writing about statistics and physics and sharing the sense of wonder with others.

I have a bachelor's degree from Reed College, where I did [my thesis](/assets/docs/deich_reed_thesis.pdf) on the effect of supernovae explosions on orbital systems. I have a master's degree in physics from San Jose State University, during which I also taught AP physics and calculus.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a modified version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
