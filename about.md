I'm a data scientist in San Francisco. I have a background in physics and a penchant for simulating things, and I like writing about computational statistics and physics.

I just received a master's in physics from San Jose State University during which time I also taught high school physics.

This website is built using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and a slightly modified version of the [Minima](https://github.com/jekyll/minima) theme.
